• I have always been very fond of skiing. I've been doing it since I was four and never plan on stopping.
• I played tennis throughout high school and enjoy it a lot.
• I enjoy learning so I'm excited for this school year.
## Technical Background
I am quite new to coding. I started about a year or so ago so my experience is minimal. I am familiar with languages such as Java and Python but definitely wouldn't say that I'm fluent. I am learning about the functions of terminal right now in CIS 241 and it is pretty cool. Hoping to get very good at it.
