* My favorite video games include Modern Warfare Remastered, Cod Black Ops 2, and MLB 
* I like playing sports like tennis and golf and enjoy skiing in winter.
* Forza is also a solid game.
## Technical Background
I am quite new to coding. I started about a year or so ago so my experience is minimal. I am familiar with languages such as Java and Python but definitely wouldn't say that I'm fluent.
